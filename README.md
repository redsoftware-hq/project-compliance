# Project Compliance
Things that we would ideally like all of our projects to be compliant to. :bowtie:

Following guidelines are quite simple because they are a layer above _Create React App_ project which standardizes a lot of stuff.

- Project Labels (with description and color code)
  - bug [Something isn't working] [#d73a4a]
  - discuss [To discuss] [#e8f9a9]
  - dx [For improved developer experience] [#fcd283]
  - enhancement [New feature or request] [#a2eeef]
  - next [To be released next] [#9718c9]
  - ready for release [Issues that are ready to be merged/released] [#ffd5c9]
  - good first issue [For project newcomers] [#7057ff]
